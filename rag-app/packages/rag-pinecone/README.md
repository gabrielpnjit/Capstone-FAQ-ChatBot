# rag-pinecone

This template performs RAG using Pinecone and OpenAI.

## Environment Setup

This template uses Pinecone as a vectorstore and requires that `PINECONE_API_KEY`, `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT`, and `PINECONE_INDEX` are set. 

Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to access the OpenAI models.

## Usage

To use this package, you should first have the LangChain CLI installed:

```shell
pip install -U langchain-cli
```

To create a new LangChain project and install this as the only package, you can do:

```shell
langchain app new my-app --package rag-pinecone
```

If you want to add this to an existing project, you can just run:

```shell
langchain app add rag-pinecone
```

And add the following code to your `server.py` file:
```python
from rag_pinecone import chain as rag_pinecone_chain

add_routes(app, rag_pinecone_chain, path="/rag-pinecone")
```

(Optional) Let's now configure LangSmith. 
LangSmith will help us trace, monitor and debug LangChain applications. 
LangSmith is currently in private beta, you can sign up [here](https://smith.langchain.com/). 
If you don't have access, you can skip this section


```shell
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
export LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=<your-project>  # if not specified, defaults to "default"
```

If you are inside this directory, then you can spin up a LangServe instance directly by:

```shell
langchain serve
```

This will start the FastAPI app with a server is running locally at 
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
