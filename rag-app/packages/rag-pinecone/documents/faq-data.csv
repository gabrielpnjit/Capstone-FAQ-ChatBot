How will the interview process work for the industry track?,"## Open House Agenda:

<:ec2:1031781180632203275> Sponsors make brief 2-MINUTE introductions about their organizations, projects, and skills sets expectations.
<:ec2:1031781180632203275> Students present themselves optionally and ask questions based on the proposed projects.
<:ec2:1031781180632203275> To sign up for a sponsor to work with, students communicate face-to-face and join the sponsor's Discord channel to register their names. During the same open house, the sponsor conducts interviews with the prospective individuals, approves them, and then arranges an initial meeting to exchange contact information and agree on the details of the first formal meeting.

## Before the open house:

-    ‚òëÔ∏è      Students will receive all project proposals with sponsors' contact information.

-    ‚òëÔ∏è      Sponsors will receive all students' names, contact information, and background information.

-     ‚òëÔ∏è Communication or approvals between students and sponsors are only allowed once the open house starts.

## At the Open House:

üîπ During the Open House time,  all sponsors must interview their applicants and approve their best 4-5 people team using an online form to share with all sponsors at the Open House. They send all approvals by 4:30 PM on the open house day, using the provided online link.

üîπ Sponsors/students must decide on their projects/teams/PMs by 4:30 PM and complete the online team selection form you will be provided with. If there are still some vacancies, we will work with the sponsors and the students to fill all available spots in the next few days.

‚òëÔ∏è Sponsors' decisions will be available instantly at (  )

‚òëÔ∏è Student confirmations will be required & available at the DISCORD STUDENTS CONFIRMATION channel.

‚òëÔ∏è Once a sponsor project placement/approval is granted, the student must confirm their acceptance by midnight on the same day via the DISCORD CONFIRMATION CHANNEL. Failure to do so will result in automatic cancellation of the approval, and the spot will become available for other students. This information is under fine-tuning and it will be part of the Canvas system shortly and the FTF training next week. Needless to say, all students who were approved and made a commitment to non-industry projects CANNOT CHANGE THEIR PROJECTS under any circumstances.
